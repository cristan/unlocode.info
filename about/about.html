        <h1><a href="/">UN/LOCODE</a>: About us</h1>
        <p>This website is basically <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/unlocode" target="_blank">the UN/LOCODE dataset</a> in website form. The dataset actually used is <a href="https://github.com/datasets/un-locode" target="_blank">https://github.com/datasets/un-locode</a> as it's a more handy release (for example: special characters actually work there).</p>
        <p>This website is open source! See <a href="https://github.com/cristan/unlocode.info" target="_blank">github.com/cristan/unlocode.info</a> for its source. Any issues/suggestions for improvements can be reported here. PR's welcome!</p>
        <p>As you explore the site, you'll notice many missing and incorrect coordinates. If this is an issue, check out <a href="https://github.com/cristan/improved-un-locodes" target="_blank">github.com/cristan/improved-un-locodes</a>. It has dramatically better coordinates. This dataset isn't used on this website though, as I wanted this site to reflect the official dataset.</p>
        <p>Want to see a change in the UN/LOCODE data? <a href="https://apps.unece.org/unlocode/" target="_blank">Do a maintenance request</a> right at the source! A new dataset is released once or twice per year, so it will take a while before any changes will show up.</p>
